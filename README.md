# The Historical Role of Capitalism in Shaping Environmental Justice: A Study of Economic Growth and CO2 Emissions from 2000 to 2022
This research examines how capitalism has influenced environmental injustice, focusing on the unequal distribution of responsibility for climate change. While developed nations have contributed most to historical emissions, underdeveloped countries often face the worst impacts despite having fewer resources to respond. The study analyzes the relationship between economic growth and COâ‚‚ emissions across low-income, newly industrialized, and developed countries from 2000 to 2022. It uses emissions data from the EIA and inflation-adjusted GDP data from the World Bank to explore global disparities in climate responsibility.
